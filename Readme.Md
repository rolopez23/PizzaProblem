# Pizza Exercise (Front-end)
One of our restaurant clients wants to know which pizza topping combinations are the most popular.

Using React, write a throw-away app that will download orders directly from `/pizzas` 
and output the top 20 most frequently ordered pizza topping combinations. 

List the toppings for each popular pizza topping combination along with its rank and the number of times that combination has been ordered.

Start the server with `npm run server`
Compile react with `npm run build`
Run both with `npm start`
